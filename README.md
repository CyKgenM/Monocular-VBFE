# Monocular-VBFE

Source control for my final-year project! Once it's in usable quality I'll make it public.

Monocular Depth Estimation based force estimation, primarly used in surgical applications, during RAMIS operations.
Inference utilizes ROS to publish the estimated force to the dVRK console.
